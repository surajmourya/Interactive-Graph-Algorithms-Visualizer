# Interactive-Graph-Algorithms-Visualizer
This project is ideal for practicing graph algorithms with an interactive visual tool. Users can add nodes, edges, and select algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s) to watch them run in real-time. It's an educational tool that demonstrates data structure understanding and development skills, making it a strong CV addition for showcasing DSA knowledge.
